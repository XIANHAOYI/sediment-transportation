# sediment-transportation
This is the MATLAB code used for the coursework in the Sediment Transport course, originally developed by Xian Haoyi. 
It is provided as a reference for colleagues studying sediment transport. The code covers calculations for Van Rijn's 
suspended load and bed load transport, Meyer-Peter's bed load calculation, Bagnold's suspended and bed load transport, 
as well as stable channel design. It is available for students of the Erasmus-Coasthazar project to reference and use.
